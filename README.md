# market-checkout

This program models a checkout area at a supermarket.  It has a deque data structure at its core to add and remove customers from the checkout lines.   The user can either run a simulation or query the database.  The simulation runs once the user has selected input parameters.  Iâ€™ve loaded some default ones (mainly for testing convenience) but they can be modified.  For no reason, other than I thought it would be interesting, I built an animation option into the simulation.  Either method of running the sim, however, gives the user a visual representation of customers processed in each queue/line, those still remaining at the end of the specified time, and those who got frustrated waiting and abandoned their carts.  Data on individual customers is available by clicking the hyperlinks.  A detailed report of simulation data can also be viewed with the option of inserting the data into the database.  The user can also build a query with optional filters and view the results.
